19674036,"Pg 234, A THOUSAND YEARS OF WEST AFRICAN HISTORY: West African Trade AD 1000-1800","THOUSAND YEARS OF WEST AFRICAN HISTORY Sea water was made to fllow into shallow ponds where it evaporated
in the heat of the sun, leaving a thick, salty crust on the ground. This deposit was scraped up, and purified by being mixed with warm water and poured through cone-shaped baskets, filled with straw. This strained off the earth. It was then re-dried in the sun, Later, when European goods became available, special shallow pans were imported as driers.) The finished salt was then packed up in baskets to be bartered with the inland peoples who had no
way of making it themselves. Cotton, imported originally from North Africa, grew plentifully on many farms and in compounds (though it was not planted systematically in plantations). In some places people specialised in weaving it and exported their woven cloths to regions where they did not weave. Some special cloths were sought after over an
enormous area (like the famous Kano cloth). West Africa is rich in easily workable mineral deposits. The archaeologists who have investigated the Nok culture of Northern Nigeria have proved that iron has been worked here for about two thousand years. So much for the assertion, which one some-
times reads, that the inhabitants of West Africa were living in the
""Stone Age' until Europeans arrived. In some places iron was extracted from the ground surface, in others shafts were tunnelled to reach the seams of iron ore. The extracted ore was smelted in furnaces (for a description of this process see Denis Williams, 'The Iconology of the Yoruba ""Edan Ogboni""', Africa, Vol. xxxIV, No. 2 (1964), p. 152). The smelted iron was then shaped into bars. Iron was an exportable commodity which could be exchanged against other goods- salt, for instance, for most of the iron deposits were inland, away from the sea. Some- times it was exported in the form of iron bars for blacksmiths to turn into swords or farming implements; sometimes it was ready manufactured by blacksmiths on the spot. Early European visitors praised the quality of the West African iron-work. The great Brazilian historian Gilberto Freyrel has pointed out that African miners and blacksmiths, transported as slaves across the
Atlantic, were responsible for the mining industry of Brazil. Other industries that produced goods for export were leather making, and perhaps soap-making.

[...]either tanned hides or hides manufactured into goods like sandals articles. soap was made from palm oil mixed with ashes. Tale out manufactured on the Plantain islands, off Sierra Leone, was such high quality in the seventeenth century that the Portuguese government are said to have prohibited it being imported into
Portugal to compete with the Portuguese soap. P The export trade, then, was based on localised industries. Some industrial workers were set apart from the rest of the (predomin- antly farming) population: miners, perhaps, and certainly black- smiths. But in some industries there were no specialised full-time workers. For example sea-salt was made by women, or by men too old to farm. Hence industrial organisation did not lead to any widespread division of labour among manual workers. Nor was there the gulf between industrial workers and peasants that more
intensive industrialisation leads to. Export trade over long distances required specialised traders who were occupied solely with transporting goods and bartering them with distant customers. They tended to follow familiar
paths from one locality to the next, so trade routes developed. People who lived on them could count on getting imported trade goods regularly. A village market might develop into a long-
distance trade market if it lay on an important trade route. People would be attracted to live there, and the village become a town. As the market grew it needed a more complicated organisa- tion: market officials to allot pitches, hear complaints and keep order. It also provided wealth for the ruler, who could levy duties
on the market people. In the village community every able-bodied person farmed: in the market town, occupations could be more specialised. In the Yoruba cities, for instance, there were many who did not farm: the Oba and his court, the market officials, and the itinerant import-export traders. Food had to be provided for them, either brought in from the surrounding villages, or grown by townspeople who went out daily to their farms. This swelled the volume of goods sold in the market, for food would be sold there, as well as imported cum no dities. Nevertheless, apart from the long-distance traders, there was no real trading class. As in the villages, the markets were carried on largely by women for whom it was a Part-time occupation though vital to the community. Nor, in the
subsistence economy of West Africa, were farmers able to grow",https://arena-images-temp.s3.amazonaws.com/function+%28t%2Cf%2Cu%29%7Bvar+l%3Df%26%26u%7C%7C0%3B%27string%27%3D%3Dtypeof+t%26%26%28f%3D%27binary%27%3D%3D%3Dt%3Fnew+Array%2816%29%3Anull%2Ct%3Dnull%29%3Bvar+v%3D%28t%3Dt%7C%7C%7B%7D%29.random%7C%7C%28t.rng%7C%7Cn%29%28%29%3Bif%28v%5B6%5D%3D15%26v%5B6%5D%7C64%2Cv%5B8%5D%3D63%26v%5B8%5D%7C128%2Cf%29for%28var+y%3D0%3By%3C16%3B%2B%2By%29f%5Bl%2By%5D%3Dv%5By%5D%3Breturn+f%7C%7Co%28v%29%7D%2FIMG_6447.jpg

hair]style on a head recovered in mid-1954 resembles that of the present-day Kachicheri and Numana,
groups of people living about thirty miles east of Nok. Taken with the evidence relating to agricultural economy, all this suggests that physically, economic-
ally and culturally the plateau-dwellers of present-day Northern Nigeria are parallel to the Nok people of old. More important still for our present purposes, it has been discovered that the sculptures of Ife and Benin are strikingly similar to those of Nok in subject
matter, as well as in the postures of the figures and their proportions. Comparisons in detail have also been made of the Nok artifacts and Ibo and Ibibio masks of Nigeria, recent Baluba carvings of the Congo and the Dan masks of the Ivory Coast.
Thus, through the help of archaeology, as of linguistics, we are gradually learning more and more about the peoples of West Africa towards the end of the first millennium of our era, about the
elements of similarity in their diverse cultures, and about the cultural traits which they have passed on, through their more immediate successors, to the people of our own day. The point made about the underlying similarity of much of West African culture in early times must not be regarded as in any way glossing over its striking diversity. There was, for instance, an equally carly and important cultural differentiation between the savannah and forest zones of West Africa; and if most of the lan-
guages of the entire arca had a common origin they subsequently diverged. Thus today, wherens the Mande languages are spoken in a large part of the savannah region, the Kwa languages prevail
in the forest belt. And even within each geographical zone clear linguistic differences are in evidence. To cite one example: Ewe, Akan and Ga in modern Ghana, and Yoruba, Nupe and Ibo in
modern Nigeria belong to the Kwa group of languages, but speakers of these Ghanaian and Nigerian languages do not at all
understand one another, although frontier populations are frequently bilingual. Similarly, in the realm of state-building, we find that although the ancient Tekrur, Ghana, Mali and Songhay empires of the savannah had their later parallels in the Mossi,
Nupe, Igala and Jukun kingdoms of the middle zone and the Asante, Dahomey, Yoruba and Benin kingdoms of the forest, each set of state systems was distinctively adapted and claborated to suit
its particular environment.

THE FOREST ZONE
In the indigenous patterns of subsistence, moreover, we find contrasts between the forest and grassland peoples during the period
under consideration. Before contact with Europeans introduced such food crops as maize and cassava, the forest peoples were predominantly cultivators depending on root crops (like yams and
cocoyams), fruit (especially bananas) and legumes. They also cultivated kola trees and obtained palm products from their forest environment. In one particular area in the west, an area stretching
from the Gambia to western Liberia, both swamp and upland rice was grown as a staple crop. None of the early Europeans reported that it had been recently introduced, in fact it had long then an important riverain crop on the middle Niger from where
it reached the forest peoples to the south and south-west. In addition to cultivation, the forest peoples kept domestic livestock such as humpless cattle, goats, pigs and poultry; and hunting and trapping were prominent in the traditional economy. Their fabrics
were mainly screwpine and raffia matting and bark-cloth. There were, as already indicated, centres of iron-smelting, and especially in parts of the transition zone between forest and savannah, iron-smithing was also fairly generally practised. Besides indigenous architecture (including the subsidiary skills of masonry and carpentry), sculpture, in the media of clay, bronze, brass, ivory and wood, was undertaken in places. These arts and crafts served
utilitarian, religious and aesthetic ends, producing private and public buildings, household utensils, stools, gongs, statues, masks,
ornaments, etc.
Before the organisation of the centralised state systems already mentioned, the old patterns of social and political organisation were generally small in scale and rooted in kinship and other ties.
A lineage system, which might be patrilineal or matrilineal, enabled kinsmen of one line of descent to maintain solidarity for internal organisation and for dealings with, the kinsmen of other
lineages. In some places this lineage principle was extended to embrace a number of local groups conceived and organised as a hindred body. In other places, particularly where the people lived in comparatively large settlements, the concept and
practice of kinship reached the level of a village organisation but scarcely anywhere were large politically centralised stales

of people and their cattle; and wild cattle are known to have ranged North Africa from Morocco to Esypi: Possibly the domestication of different breeds of cattle was achieved independently in both Asia and Africa. Be that as it may, cattle were used in the Western and Central Sudan from an early date. They provided, besides porterage, large supplies of meat and dairy products; they furnished the hides and skins from which was manufactured the ""morocco' leather for which Kano--the future emporium and
entrepôt of the Central Sudan which we begin to hear of by now (A.D. 999) - was to become famous. Other arts and crafts under. taken by the savannah men included construction with sun-dried bricks of buildings decorated with vaults and arches; weaving of cotton on narrow and broad looms; lost-wax casting in bronze and brass; and delicate, ornamental work in silver and gold. With the products of these crafts and other activities trade was carried on with the forest regions to the south and with North
Africa beyond the desert. Across the Sudan and southwards to the forest fringes the donkey and the bullock (besides human beings) were the principal carriers of trade goods to and from the countries
of the Bure, Lobi, Asante, Yoruba, Nupe, Igala and Jukun. In the north, with the introduction of the camel, caravan trade grew apace and commercial towns flourished. Long before the beginning of the Christian era there were three major trade routes between
the southern and northern shores of the desert. In the west a highway ran from Morocco through Adar to the middle Senegal and upper Niger; in the centre, from Tripoli through Ghadames and Ghat to Gao in the middle Niger; and in the east, from Tripoli
through Murzuq and Bilma to jimi in Kanem. The conductors of this trade were mainly Berbers: nomadic, fair-skinned people who inhabited North África and the oases of the desert from Mauritania to Ahaggar as far south as the Sudan. They
established settlements in commercial centres of the Sudan where they exchanged the manufactured goods of the Mediterranean lands silks, beads, mirrors, swords and (as literacy spread) paper
-and dates and salt of the Sahara, with the commodities of the West African savannah and forest--gold, grain, gum, hides and skins, ostrich feathers, ivory, kola nuts and slaves.
In the sphere of social and political organisation, we also find that the evolution of ruling aristocracies, political centralisation and administrative government predated the advent of Islam in",https://arena-images-temp.s3.amazonaws.com/function+%28t%2Cf%2Cu%29%7Bvar+l%3Df%26%26u%7C%7C0%3B%27string%27%3D%3Dtypeof+t%26%26%28f%3D%27binary%27%3D%3D%3Dt%3Fnew+Array%2816%29%3Anull%2Ct%3Dnull%29%3Bvar+v%3D%28t%3Dt%7C%7C%7B%7D%29.random%7C%7C%28t.rng%7C%7Cn%29%28%29%3Bif%28v%5B6%5D%3D15%26v%5B6%5D%7C64%2Cv%5B8%5D%3D63%26v%5B8%5D%7C128%2Cf%29for%28var+y%3D0%3By%3C16%3B%2B%2By%29f%5Bl%2By%5D%3Dv%5By%5D%3Breturn+f%7C%7Co%28v%29%7D%2F48A93E65-91EF-4DA4-8121-C3466AEF25AC.jpg

with an administrative and territorial system of government
established till some time after A.D. 1000.
Whatever its size, the local community of the forest zone was virtually autonomous, with its own machinery for upholding discipline and maintaining law and order. In this respect the age;
sex, character, wealth and general social standing of individuals played an important part; so also did status associations, age-grades and cult organisations. At the same time each community had
external contacts with similar neighbouring groups. Such intercourse was fostered by friendship and marriage, alliance and trade, as well as by community of interest in religion and in outlook on
lil generally. Thus was it possible to promote widespread similar-ity of language, custom and social life over a fairy large area; beliefs, skills and innovations could also spread fast and far from
group to group; and on the whole a sense of cultural unity was maintained among a considerable number of communities.

THE SAVANNAH
With respect to the savannah peoples, Islam reached the region in the eighth century A.D., the date from which the written history of West Africa begins. The writings of Arab Muslim chroniclers about West Africa appeared in the wake of the religion of the
Prophet: Ibn Munnabch wrote in A.D, 738, followed later by Al. Masudi in A.D. 947. But the rocords of these chroniclers, together with more recent ethnographic evidence, indicate that naturally
the subsistence patterns of the savannah peoples, like their ideas and belief and customs, for long persisted everywhere in varying degrees, Generally the grassland dwellers cultivated grain, but
their scope and efficiency differed widely from place to place.
There were, for instance, some people of what we now call Northern Nigeria who grew mainly one type of small grain; and some peoples of present-day Northern Ghana who cultivated varieties of millet, using light hoes which did not penetrate deep
into the soil. There were, on the other hand, the Hausa of Northern Nigeria and the Bambara and Mandingo of Mali who dug deep into the ground and raised ridges for their millet, while at the same time irrigating the fields for cotton and other special
crops.
The impact of Islam was not responsible for the first develop-ment of agriculture in the Western and Central Sudan'. As a matter of fact one recent writer, G.P. Murdock, has even put forward the bold hypothesis that agriculture was genuinely 
 invented and food plants independently domesticated in the
Mandingo country in the upper Niger basin. Murdock has how-ever been seriously criticised for this; but whether his thesis will stand the test of criticism or not, he has attempted to represent West Africa as an active participant, rather than a passive recipient,
in the skilled processes of development of agricultural techniques and domestication of food plants. At all events, there has been a long tradition of successful cultivation of specialised crops in the Western and Central Sudan, a tradition dating from much earlier
than the period of this discussion.
The savannah peoples, furthermore, were skilled in tending animals. Livestock was reared by people like the Wolof and Serer of Senegal, or later by the almost ubiquitous Fulani who often arranged a mode of living with the settled peoples in whose fields
They roamed and grazed their herds and flocks. Of the varied live.
stock kept, the beasts of burden camels, horses and donkeys-demand especial mention. Although this is a subject of controversy among scholars, it is generally believed that the camel was intro-duced from the East into North Africa before the Christian era,
and thence into the Sudan early in the first millennium A.D. In addition to its high carrying capacity and its singular ability to
travel for many days without water, the camel-particularly the riding camel (mehari) bred for speed--can move much faster than the bullock, for instance. The horse is also of extra-African origin.
It served not only as a pack-animal but also as a military and political instrument whereby military force could be concentrated at short notice and communication maintained between capital
and province. The donkey, as is now generally accepted, was on the other hand domesticated in north-eastern Africa. It was, to the ordinary savannah inhabitant, the beast of burden par excellence,
not requiring large capital investment but able to convey heavy loads of grain, raw material and craft products from field and village to granary and town.
Attention might also be called to cattle. The domestication of these animals has been claimed for Western Asia but, though he has been criticised by his countrymen, a French writer has suggested that they were brought into human society in the
Sahara where, as you may recall, there are ancient rock painting:",https://arena-images-temp.s3.amazonaws.com/function+%28t%2Cf%2Cu%29%7Bvar+l%3Df%26%26u%7C%7C0%3B%27string%27%3D%3Dtypeof+t%26%26%28f%3D%27binary%27%3D%3D%3Dt%3Fnew+Array%2816%29%3Anull%2Ct%3Dnull%29%3Bvar+v%3D%28t%3Dt%7C%7C%7B%7D%29.random%7C%7C%28t.rng%7C%7Cn%29%28%29%3Bif%28v%5B6%5D%3D15%26v%5B6%5D%7C64%2Cv%5B8%5D%3D63%26v%5B8%5D%7C128%2Cf%29for%28var+y%3D0%3By%3C16%3B%2B%2By%29f%5Bl%2By%5D%3Dv%5By%5D%3Breturn+f%7C%7Co%28v%29%7D%2FIMG_5753.jpg
